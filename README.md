# Calculator App üßÆ

## Overview üìã:

This repository contains a simple calculator application developed in Java using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for the graphical user interface. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consists of two Java files:

- `CalFrame.java`: This file contains the main class responsible for creating the calculator's graphical user interface.
- `CalAction.java`: This file contains an ActionListener implementation that handles button clicks and performs arithmetic operations.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è :

Before running the calculator application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è :

To run the calculator application on your system, follow these steps:

1. Open your command prompt (CMD) or terminal.

2. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository.

3. Compile the Java files by running the following command:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   
4. After successfully compiling, run the application with the following command:
   
   ```bash
